## 📖 Overview

SDPD is a gamified learning platform that teaches distributed systems design concepts through interactive detective cases. Instead of reading theory, you solve **33 real-world system failure scenarios** where you must:

1. **Investigate** — Inspect system components and logs to understand what failed
2. **Diagnose** — Identify the root cause of the failure
3. **Solve** — Recommend the appropriate fix to prevent recurrence

Each case is tied to specific distributed systems concepts (replication, consistency, load balancing, caching, messaging, storage, networking, and more), making learning engaging and practical.

## 📚 How It Works

### Game Flow

1. **Home Page** — View all 33 cases organized by concept category
   - See your current rank and progress percentage
   - Click on a case to begin investigation

2. **Case Investigation** — For each case:
   - **Read the Brief** — Understand the scenario, symptoms, and objective
   - **Inspect the Diagram** — Click nodes to view logs and system data
   - **Diagnose Root Cause** — Answer multiple-choice questions about what failed
   - **Recommend Fix** — Answer follow-up questions about the solution
   - **Earn Badge** — Complete the case and unlock the next one

3. **Progression**
   - Cases unlock sequentially (complete case N to unlock case N+1)
   - Your rank automatically upgrades based on completed cases
   - All progress persists across sessions

### Case Categories

| Category | Cases | Concepts |
|----------|-------|----------|
| 🔄 **Replication** | 1-3 | Leader-follower, redundancy, failover |
| 🎯 **Consistency** | 4-8 | CAP theorem, eventual consistency, conflict resolution |
| ⚖️ **Load Balancing** | 9-13 | Distribution algorithms, health checks, sticky sessions |
| 💾 **Caching** | 14-17 | Cache invalidation, TTL, write-through strategies |
| 📬 **Messaging** | 18-21 | Message queues, delivery guarantees, backpressure |

## 🎓 Creating New Cases

Cases are defined as JSON files. Here's the structure:

```json
{
  "id": "case-01",
  "number": 1,
  "title": "The Single Point of Failure",
  "subtitle": "Criminal records go dark across all precincts",
  "brief": {
    "narrative": "Story describing the system failure...",
    "symptoms": [
      "Symptom 1",
      "Symptom 2"
    ],
    "objective": "What needs to be solved..."
  },
  "diagram": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "db-central",
        "type": "database",
        "label": "Central Records DB",
        "status": "failed",
        "position": { "x": 350, "y": 50 },
        "inspectable": true,
        "inspectData": {
          "title": "Component Name",
          "logs": ["[time] Log message"],
          "data": { "key": "value" },
          "status": "Status description"
        }
      }
    ],
    "edges": [
      {
        "id": "edge-1",
        "source": "db-central",
        "target": "server-1",
        "label": "Connection",
        "style": "normal"
      }
    ]
  },
  "diagnosis": {
    "rootCause": {
      "question": "What is the root cause?",
      "options": [
        {
          "id": "opt-1",
          "text": "Correct answer",
          "correct": true,
          "feedback": "Explanation of why this is correct..."
        }
      ]
    },
    "fix": {
      "question": "How do we fix this?",
      "options": []
    }
  },
  "conceptId": "replication-basics",
  "badge": {
    "name": "Replication Master",
    "icon": "🔄"
  }
}
```

**Node Types:** `database`, `server`, `client`  
**Node Status:** `healthy`, `degraded`, `failed`  
**Edge Styles:** `normal`, `broken`, `slow`

To add a new case:
1. Create `src/data/cases/case-XX.json`
2. Create translation: `src/data/cases/pt-BR/case-XX.json`
3. Increment case count in code if needed

---

## 🌍 Internationalization

SDPD supports English and Portuguese (Brazil). Translations are in:
- `src/i18n/locales/en.json`
- `src/i18n/locales/pt-BR.json`
- Case files: `src/data/cases/pt-BR/`

To add a new language:
1. Create `src/i18n/locales/[locale].json`
2. Update `src/i18n/index.ts` to export new locale type
3. Add case translations in `src/data/cases/[locale]/`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Cases don't appear
- Ensure case JSON files are in `src/data/cases/`
- Check case `number` fields are sequential
- Verify JSON syntax is valid

### Progress not saving
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Open DevTools → Application → Storage → Local Storage
- Look for `game-state` key

### Icons appear cut off
- Clear browser cache
- Try `npm run build` and `npm run preview`
- Check SVG `preserveAspectRatio` attributes

### Translation missing
- Verify key exists in both locale files
- Check `useTranslation()` is imported correctly
- Run `npm run lint` to catch missing keys
